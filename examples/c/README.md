# Examples for C
For each function there will be an example create with Visual Studio but not for all single devices.
Some IO-Warrior will have special functions. For example the 'RC5' function will only be supported be the IO-Warrior24 (descontinued).
The 'digital LED' function only by IOW28 and IOW100.  
There will be an example project for each special mode. The most examples will bases on the IO-Warrior28. 
A list about the supported funtions can be found on the [main readme](https://github.com/codemercs-com/io-warrior-win) page.  


## Differences between the IO-Warrior communication
The main difference for software between the IO-Warrior is the report size for the communication and the used pipes.
Report size mean how many bytes will be write / read per transcation.
