# Examples for C
For each function there will be an example create with Visual Studio but not for all single devices. The functions will be different for the IO-Warrior devices. For example the 'RC5' function will only be supported be the IO-Warrior24 (descontinued). The 'digital LED' function only by IOW28 and IOW100.

In the 'basic' directory will be an example for each IO-Warrior device to show how it works and what the difference is between the devices itself.  
The main difference is the report size for the communication and the used pipes.
